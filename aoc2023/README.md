# Advent of Code 2023
This is the first advent of code that I did  end to end. I started this advent of code late (started on 12/27/2023) but wanted to complete this advent of code anyways to have fun and relearn Rust.

## Day 1
This challenge was relatively straightforward, but since I was still unfamiliar with the language (relearning Rust after using it last in my college classes) I used [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOgQMjpGum0) to help walk through the Rust semantics and also learn some tools built into the language. Overall, this challenge helped me start refamiliarizing myself with Rust and also warming up for the following more challenging problems.
